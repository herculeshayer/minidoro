# MiniDoro ‚è∞ - In Development üî®ü™ì

### 19 - DEC - 22
Moving project over to AWS using serverless architecture + API Gateway
Splitting project into own folders as previous structure was a hack to work on Heroku

TODO:
1. Successfully migrate project to AWS
2. Save data from user usage DB (users will be allows to view their progress)
3. Allow custom timers but split by 25 minute intervals
4. Styling (NavBar, register/login pages, etc)
5. Script for local setup? (download all programs necessary for local development i.e. node, sass, vscode, docker, postman, etc)


### Hosting
Frontend: https://minidoro.netlify.com/ 

~~ Backend:https://minidoro.herokuapp.com/~~


### Application Description
This application is a pomodoro timer that allows users to sign in and log their work intervals

The design of the website will be minimal.

~~This application will utilize Heroku as it's backend hosting platform. Heroku free-tier dynos idle when not in use so it creates an issue with users desire for quick load times. The reason for using Heroku is because I've already used AWS and a hosting platform and decided to try Heroku.~~

The application frontend is created using React and is hosted on Netlify
