# Pomodoro Application - In Progress⏲️ 🍅

https://minidoro.netlify.com/ --> Frontend

https://minidoro.herokuapp.com/ --> Backend



### Application Description
This application is a pomodoro timer that allows users to sign in and log their work intervals

The design of the website will be minimal.

This application will utilize Heroku as it's backend hosting platform. Heroku free-tier dynos idle when not in use so it creates an issue with users desire for quick load times. The reason for using Heroku is because I've already used AWS and a hosting platform and decided to try Heroku.

The application frontend is created using React and is hosted on Netlify
