# Pomodoro Application - In Progress⏲️ 🍅

https://minidoro.herokuapp.com/ --> App is hosted on a free heroku dyno, give it a few seconds to load



### Application Description
This application is a pomodoro timer that allows users to sign in with a number of methods provided by Auth0. i.e. Create an account, Google, Facebook, etc.

The design of the website will be minimal. The bulk of the program will be on the backend. 

This application will utilize Heroku as it's hosting platform. Heroku free-tier dynos idle when not in use so it creates an issue with users desire for quick load times. The reason for using Heroku is because I've already used AWS and a hosting platform and decided to try Heroku before GCP or Azure.
